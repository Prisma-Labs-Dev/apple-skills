## Overview

The `Actor` protocol generalizes over all `actor` types. Actor types implicitly conform to this protocol.

### Actors and SerialExecutors

By default, actors execute tasks on a shared global concurrency thread pool. This pool is shared by all default actors and tasks, unless an actor or task specified a more specific executor requirement.

It is possible to configure an actor to use a specific [SerialExecutor](/documentation/swift/serialexecutor), as well as impact the scheduling of default tasks and actors by using a [TaskExecutor](/documentation/swift/taskexecutor).

## Inherits From

- [Sendable](/documentation/swift/sendable)
- [SendableMetatype](/documentation/swift/sendablemetatype)

## Conforming Types

- [MainActor](/documentation/swift/mainactor)

## Instance Properties

- [unownedExecutor](/documentation/swift/actor/unownedexecutor) Retrieve the executor for this actor as an optimized, unowned reference.

## Instance Methods

- [assertIsolated(_:file:line:)](/documentation/swift/actor/assertisolated(_:file:line:)) Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.
- [assumeIsolated(_:file:line:)](/documentation/swift/actor/assumeisolated(_:file:line:)) Assume that the current task is executing on this actor’s serial executor, or stop program execution otherwise.
- [preconditionIsolated(_:file:line:)](/documentation/swift/actor/preconditionisolated(_:file:line:)) Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.
- [withSerialExecutor(_:)](/documentation/swift/actor/withserialexecutor(_:)-4ff11) Perform an operation with the actor’s [SerialExecutor](/documentation/swift/serialexecutor).
- [withSerialExecutor(_:)](/documentation/swift/actor/withserialexecutor(_:)-4ucv5) Perform an operation with the actor’s [SerialExecutor](/documentation/swift/serialexecutor).

## Actors

- [Sendable](/documentation/swift/sendable) A thread-safe type whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races.
- [MainActor](/documentation/swift/mainactor) A singleton actor whose executor is equivalent to the main dispatch queue.
- [GlobalActor](/documentation/swift/globalactor) A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate various declarations anywhere in the program.
- [SendableMetatype](/documentation/swift/sendablemetatype) A type whose metatype can be shared across arbitrary isolation domains without introducing a risk of data races.
- [isolation()](/documentation/swift/isolation()) Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.
