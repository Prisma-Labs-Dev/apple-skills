## Overview

The `Product` type represents the in-app purchases that you configure in App Store Connect and make available for purchase within your app. Use `Product` to perform all product-related tasks in your app, from displaying in-app purchases and offers to making a purchase and getting transaction and subscription status information.

To get a `Product` instance, call [products(for:)](/documentation/storekit/product/products(for:)) and provide one or more in-app purchase product identifiers. Use a `Product` instance to display in-app purchases and subscription offers in your store, as follows:

- Show the localized name, description, and pricing information using [displayName](/documentation/storekit/product/displayname), [description](/documentation/storekit/product/description), and [displayPrice](/documentation/storekit/product/displayprice), respectively.
- Determine whether a user is eligible for an introductory offer for the product using [isEligibleForIntroOffer](/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/iseligibleforintrooffer).
- Display your subscription offers using the subscription information in [subscription](/documentation/storekit/product/subscription).

When users initiate a purchase, call [purchase(options:)](/documentation/storekit/product/purchase(options:)) or [purchase(confirmIn:options:)](/documentation/storekit/product/purchase(confirmin:options:)-3bivf) on the product instance. If your app uses SwiftUI, you can also use [PurchaseAction](/documentation/storekit/purchaseaction). Set purchase options ([Product.PurchaseOption](/documentation/storekit/product/purchaseoption)) to define an optional app account token, apply a promotional offer, or set a product quantity. Purchase options can also simulate an Ask to Buy scenario when you’re testing your app in the sandbox environment.

Use a `Product` instance to learn whether a user is entitled to a product by checking [currentEntitlement](/documentation/storekit/product/currententitlement), which holds the transaction that entitles the user to the product. This transaction information, as well as the transaction in [latestTransaction](/documentation/storekit/product/latesttransaction), are cryptographically signed by the App Store in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format.

If the product is an auto-renewable subscription, use the [status](/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.property) and [renewalInfo](/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/renewalinfo) in the [subscription](/documentation/storekit/product/subscription) information to help manage subscriptions and inform business decisions, such as presenting subscription offers.

For information about configuring In-App Purchases in App Store Connect, see [Overview for configuring In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases).
